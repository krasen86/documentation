# Dentistimo Documentation

# WHAT
The aim of this system is to provide end-users with an interface to book dentist appointments in Gothenburg. For convenient use the dentist clinics are displayed on a map that the user can navigate. The system is built distributed with publish-subscribe as the main architectural style. 

# WHY
The current system for booking dental appointments in Sweden is currently very unpolished, and everyone who’s trying to get appointments are usually faced with fully booked dentists clinics. Currently to be able to find an available time, you’d have to do a lot of time-consuming, manual labor in the manner of browsing different websites, making many phone calls, often leading to unsuccessful attempts to book appointments.

# HOW
The system will make use of a map API in order to display all existing dentist clinics in the Gothenburg area to the user. The user will be able to navigate the map, choose a clinic, and see the available appointment time slots for a date. The user will then be able to book a time slot, and the system will process the request.

# Software Architecture
## Architecture overview

The system is designed as a distributed system where every component/subsystem acts as an independent node. The main architectural style used for communication and data transfer between components is publish-subscribe. The client subscribes and listens to the a MQTT broker for different topics, but can publish as well (e.g. whilst creating the booking requests).
<br><br>
The BookingUI uses a client-server architectural style for communicating with the idGenerator component. The BookingUI requests userId and requestId while the idGenerator has the responsibility to issue and maintain the user/request information. Furthermore, the dentistRegistry takes advantage of the client-server architectural style in order to continuously retrieve the clinics' information from the external dentist registry API by using an HTTP request. [2020-12-14]
<br><br>
The team designed a broker listener component that receives all incoming messages from the broker and filters them to the corresponding handlers and controllers following simple separation of concerns and GRASP design principles. The BookingUI also uses Model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) style in order to optimize the use of Vue.js and Vuex frontend framework functionality, especially the reactivity. Moreover, using this framework and the MVVM pattern allows for further decoupling between the business logic and UI components. The components on the backend are also using publish-subscribe pattern to communicate with each other, while the messages are processed by listeners and controllers to handle the availability filtering of opening hours and booking requests as well as handling the booking.

### Architecture styles

- Publish-subscribe: between the components and the corresponding subsystems
- Client-server: Used to integrate the external dentist registry API by using HTTP request. Also used between the idGenerator(server) and BookingUI(client) by using RPC API [2020-12-14]

### Design patterns and principles

- Model-view-viewmodel (MVVM): used in the frontend UI components with Vuejs framework and Vuex
- GRASP and SOLID principles for low level class design for the business logic part, especially single-responsibility and separation of concerns.

### Architectural Drivers

Main architectural driver taken into consideration when designing the system and choosing architectural styles are:

- Scalability: since a distributed, decoupled system well allows us to scale the different components when needed to adapt to the incoming request. Since the components can run on separate nodes we can scale the different components at different times.
- Maintainability: since the components are decoupled that will allow us to maintain them easier, for example different teams can maintain different components. That will increase the reusability of the components and their modifiability.
- Portability: Since the components are independent and use a MQTT broker to communicate they can be deployed on different nodes and easily be replaced with other logical units since the communication happens only through a common interface and the components are logically decoupled.

## Sequence Diagrams

### Sequence Diagram for Use Case: Make a booking

#### Description
The diagram represents a high-level sequence and actions needed to make a booking as well as the corresponding components involved. The diagram displays only the subsystems involved in making a booking request for simplicity. The steps/sequences and components involved in performing the use case for every single subsystem can be seen in specific use case diagrams for those components. A pre-requisite for this use case is assumed that the UI component has received and displayed the dentist's time slots and that the user has selected a time, date and a clinic and the user has provided the needed data in the booking form. The use case starts the moment the user confirms the booking in the UI booking form.

# Technical Overview 

## Fault tolerance

The main use case that the team has identified by taking in consideration both the project's requirements and constrains is creating a booking to one of the available dentist clinics. Consequently, the component that shall act as the main entry point in order to process, forward and respond the corresponding requests is the [Booking](https://github.com/krasen86/booking). Therefore, as far as introducing a fault-tolerance mechanism is concerned, a request rate limiter has been implemented as part of the booking component. <br>
Specifically, whenever the number of incoming requests exceeds the rate of 100 booking requests in 10 seconds then the rate limiter denies any new ones, hence preventing the system from experiencing any downtime due to any possible Denial of Service attacks. In the event that the incoming requests return to the normal rate (less or equal to 100reqs/s) then they should be accepted from system and therefore returning to the previous normal operating state. <br><br>
As soon as the rate-limiter gets activated we consider the status of the booking component being in overload or “attack” mode, therefore those requests are considered as malicious ones and are not being processed. The booking component does not respond since currently we do not want to overload the network and broker. We are however logging those requests into the DB and they can be further examined if needed. The DB is also designed with request entities that can be used in the future to store those requests and process them if the system is further developed with more advanced form of fault-tolerance. <br><br>
Ultimately, as a way to visualize the rate limiter's functionality, the incoming requests are both logged in the backend's running server console as well as in the component's database (MongoDB). Below you can see an indicative example of recorded console messages for both an accepted and a denied request:

```
2020-12-17T00:00:00.000Z [Accepted] info: Request id: 41 User id: uuid-176704a278061b8b1 Dentist id: 1
2020-12-17T00:00:00.000Z [Denied] warn: Request id: 57 User id: uuid-176704a278471268f Dentist id: 1
```

## Quality of service
The number in the parentheses refers to the number of the data-flow number of the component-diagram.

- (1) Publish clinics data
  - Qos: 1
  - Reasoning: The requirement is that changes to the dentist registry must be handled by the system in less than 10 minutes. Therefore, the system makes sure when a change occurs it is at least published once. Multiple publications don't effect the system too much since, other components compare the incoming dentist files to the current one and only update when it differs.
- (2) Publish available timeslots
  - Qos: 1
  - Reasoning: Publishing the availability of timeslots for a clinic is quite important for making a booking, but it gets updated frequently. Therefore, the team has chosen a qos of 1 to increase the likelihood that the message gets received without the overhead of a qos 2. 
- (2x) Publish availability per date
  - Qos: 0
  - Reasoning: This type of data is not crucial for the main use case of making a booking, and it is a lot of data. Even a qos of 1 would lead to massive traffic, therefore the team decided to send this data at most once.
- (4) Booking request
  - Qos: 1
  - Reasoning: By publishing this kind of data, other components get triggered to process a booking. Therefore, the initial plan was to use qos: 2, to make sure the processing methods only get triggered once. However, by the overhead of making sure a message is only received once, the speed of the system decreased so much, that it was not satisfying to use anymore. Hence, the team decreased the qos to 1, because even when some methods get triggered twice, the speed for making a booking increased by a big margin.
- (5) Timeslot verification request
  - Qos: 1
  - Reasoning: By publishing this kind of data, other components get triggered to process a booking. Therefore, the initial plan was to use qos: 2, to make sure the processing methods only get triggered once. However, by the overhead of making sure a message is only received once, the speed of the system decreased so much, that it was not satisfying to use anymore. Hence, the team decreased the qos to 1, because even when some methods get triggered twice, the speed for making a booking increased by a big margin.
- (6) Timeslot verification response
  - Qos: 1
  - Reasoning: By publishing this kind of data, other components get triggered to process a booking. Therefore, the initial plan was to use qos: 2, to make sure the processing methods only get triggered once. However, by the overhead of making sure a message is only received once, the speed of the system decreased so much, that it was not satisfying to use anymore. Hence, the team decreased the qos to 1, because even when some methods get triggered twice, the speed for making a booking increased by a big margin.
- (7) Booking response
  - Qos: 1
  - Reasoning: By publishing this kind of data, other components get triggered to process a booking. Therefore, the initial plan was to use qos: 2, to make sure the processing methods only get triggered once. However, by the overhead of making sure a message is only received once, the speed of the system decreased so much, that it was not satisfying to use anymore. Hence, the team decreased the qos to 1, because even when some methods get triggered twice, the speed for making a booking increased by a big margin.

## Testing

The team conducted manual testing of the different components, in order to verify both their individual functionality as well as the integration of them as part of the whole distributed system. The test cases that were covered are listed in this [spreadsheet document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sVrW3H8GXKU8Zqsqo28yDHBOg3JuYMPrxIKelI0E1I8/edit?usp=sharing), which provides a description of them, a mapping to the requirements under test as well as the corresponding outcomes that help identify any possible issues.

In addition, some unit tests were added in the bookingUI component that mostly cover the rendering of the respective sub-components.

## Known issues

1. Date timezone js problem - Inconsistency in the timeslotProcessor when creating timeslots around midnight based on timezones and daylight savings time.
2. Not removing files/timeslots when clinic is deleted - Files of deleted clinics are not removed from the timeslotProcessor.
3. Cannot delete clinic day - The external data source needs to provide opening hours for all weekdays except Saturday and Sunday.
4. Winston-mongoDB issue for MAC - The OS sometimes throws connection errors when trying to communicate with mongoDB.
